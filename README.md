### Course descriptions and outcomes

#### Course units

The CIS department's `600` courses follow three major "units" common to all students, regardless of major. These are:

* Demo day preparation (project narrative)
* Advising (advanced project research, artifact development)
* Reporting (thesis document writing)

These units guide the tasks (activies and prompts) that we will complete through the semester. Work completed during
each unit will further your progress toward the global assignment due at the end of each unit.

#### Major-specific outcomes

This syllabus governs the following `600`-level courses in the Allegheny College Department of Computer and Information Science. While we meet weekly as one large group, each of us will pursue different course outcomes from our work. See the appropriate course below to review the learning outcomes that this course provides.

- [`CMPSC 600`](#cmpsc-600)
- [`DS 600`](#ds-600)
- [`INFM 600`](#infm-600)
- [`SE 600`](#se-600)

##### `CMPSC 600`

- Evaluate the produced prototype and reflect on theoretical, practical, ethical and social impact of the proposed artifact.
- Produce an original project that integrates multiple disciplines and provides critical engagement of impact of technology on various communities.

##### `SE 600`

Must be taken on the letter-grade basis. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

### Evaluation

This course uses several methods for evaluation which appraise:

- the product of your work
- the process used to arrive that that product
- the narrative/story you tell about your product and process

The evaluative criteria in this course do not weight these equally, and place emphasis on process and presentation; however,
this does not make the product(s) of your work inconsequential. By nature, a good process necessitates a good product. There
is no substitute for high-quality, iterative effort. In short, the only way to guarantee good outcomes in this course is to
spend time and care on each part of the process.

#### Criteria

This course features two categories of evaluative criteria: `Process` and `Product`.

| Mechanic   | Category | Evaluative weight |
|:-----------|:---------|:------------------|
|Research Journal | `Process` | 30%         |
|Class activities | `Process`   | 25%       |
|Computational artifact |`Product`| 15%     |
|Demo day presentation | `Product` | 15%    |
|Thesis writing   | `Product` | 15%         |

##### Criteria detail

###### Research Journal

Your research journal is a public account of your research process. Each week, you will be given a prompt and a related activity
(see [below](#class-activities) for details on activities). For each week of the semester, you must write a post of at least
`250` words which responds to the prompt and includes elements of the related activity.

Students must complete these posts within `1 week`; posts are assigned on Fridays during class sessions and must be completed
by the start of the following Friday's session. They will be used as part of a class check-in activity at the beginning of each
Friday session.

###### Class Activities

These activities will produce deliverables with corresponding [`Research Journal`](#research-jounal) entries. Activities range
in scope depending on the current course unit and may involve writing, visualizations, or other work product. These activities
are meant to contribute content to on-going global tasks.

###### Computational artifact

All students completing projects under a CIS major are expected to produce a computational artifact. This artifact may include (but
is not limited to):

* source code in a Github version-controlled repository
* documentation of source code, its use, and relevant executable binaries
* theory- or evidence-based writing on a computational subject
* extensive use of collected or extant data sources

The ultimate expression and form of a project constitues a primary concern of conversations with project advisor(s).
In close consultation with your reader(s), researchers arrive at the most suitable product for their intended outcome(s).

###### Demo day presentation

At roughly the one-quarter mark in the semester, students will give a "Demo Day" presentation. These presentations are
focused on the _narrative_ of your project: its origin, uses, and overall impact. The purpose of this presentation is 
to convey a project's:

* overview
* value
* efficacy
* future direction

The underlying motivation for requiring student presentations is to both provide practice for clearly and concisely describing
a project and for allowing others in department's research community to evalute the overall soundness of a project's plan and
purpose. Often, if a researcher can't clearly articulate what their project _is_ and _does_, it suggests that there's still work
to do in project planning before moving to any building-out phase.

These presentations are limited to `5` minutes and _no_ time for Q & A. Instead, presenters will receive the results of a feedback
survey that audiences will fill out during the presentation.

###### Thesis writing

All researchers must also document their work in the form of a written thesis. While variations on the typical structure and
contents of a thesis can be specific to a certain project, a typical CIS department thesis contains `5` sections:

1. Introduction
2. Related Work
3. Methods
4. Experiments
5. Conclusions

During the `600` semester course, students will complete sections `1` and `2` for review by their reader(s). Thesis writing
templates and materials will be distributed later in the semester after Demo Day.

### Class sessions

The Faculty organize course sessions to achieve `3` main goals:

* check-in on project stage progress
* further development of `1` specific aspect of the current project stage
* broader weekly goal-setting for individual [course units](#course-units)
