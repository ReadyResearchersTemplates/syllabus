### Course descriptions and outcomes

This syllabus governs the following `600`-level courses in the Allegheny College Department of Computer and Information Science. While we meet weekly as one large group, each of us will pursue different course outcomes from our work. See the appropriate course below to review the learning outcomes that this course provides.

- [`CMPSC 600`](#cmpsc-600)
- [`DS 600`](#ds-600)
- [`INFM 600`](#infm-600)
- [`SE 600`](#se-600)

#### `CMPSC 600`

Independent research in computer science culminating in the development of prototype or early draft of a computational artifact. Must be taken on the letter-grade basis. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

##### Learning Outcomes

- Develop a viable and appropriate proposal for an independent and open-source research project.
- Describe a research process, its methods, and outcomes in writing in the form of an incremental research notebook and two chapters of a formal thesis document.
- Present and communicate complex ideas in a variety of media through both informal discussions, peer reviews and formal presentations.
- Produce and document a working prototype of computational artifact.
- Evaluate the produced prototype and reflect on theoretical, practical, ethical and social impact of the proposed artifact.
- Produce an original project that includes integration of theory and practice or software and hardware.

#### `DS 600`

Independent research in data science culminating in the development of a prototype or early draft of a computational artifact. Must be taken on the letter-grade basis. Must be taken on the letter-grade basis.

- Present and communicate complex ideas in a variety of media through both informal discussions, peer reviews and formal presentations.
- Produce and document a working prototype of a data-oriented artifact.
- Evaluate the produced prototype and reflect on theoretical, practical, ethical and social impact of the proposed artifact.
- Produce an original project that uses a large, complex data set to create a web dashboard or extend an existing data science framework via analysis.

#### `INFM 600`

Independent research in informatics culminating in the development of a prototype or early draft of a computational artifact. Must be taken on the letter-grade basis. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

##### Learning Outcomes

- Present and communicate complex ideas in a variety of media through both informal discussions, peer reviews and formal presentations.
- Produce and document a working prototype of an information-informed artifact.
- Evaluate the produced prototype and reflect on theoretical, practical, ethical and social impact of the proposed artifact.
- Produce an original project that integrates multiple disciplines and provides critical engagement of impact of technology on various communities.

#### `SE 600`

Independent research in software engineering culminating in the development of a prototype or early draft of a computational artifact. Must be taken on the letter-grade basis. Must be taken on the letter-grade basis. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

##### Learning Outcomes

- Describe a research process, its methods, and outcomes in writing in the form of an incremental research notebook and two chapters of a formal thesis document.
- Present and communicate complex ideas in a variety of media through both informal discussions, peer reviews, and formal presentations.
- Produce and document a working prototype of an engineered software artifact.
- Evaluate the produced prototype and reflect on theoretical, practical, ethical, and social impact of the produced artifact.
- Produce an original software project that is working, well-tested, and deployed into production use.

### Evaluation

This course uses several methods for evaluation which appraise:

- the product of your work
- the process used to arrive that that product
- the way that you present your product and process

The evaluative criteria in this course do not weight these equally, and place emphasis on process and presentation; however,
this does not make the product(s) of your work inconsequential. By nature, a good process necessitates a good product. There
is no substitute for high-quality, iterative effort. In short, the only way to guarantee good outcomes in this course is to
spend time and care on each part of the process.

#### Criteria

This course features two categories of evaluative criteria: `Process` and `Product`.

|Deliverable | Category | Evaluative weight |
|:-----------|:---------|:------------------|
|Research Journal | `Process` | 30%         |
|Class activities | `Process`   | 30%       |
|Demo day presentation | `Product` | 20%    |
|Thesis writing   | `Product` | 20%         |
